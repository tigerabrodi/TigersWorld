                <h1 class="places-card-title">Henry Doorly Zoo</h1>
                <p class="places-card-text">In 2014 this zoo was rated the best in the world by Trip Advisor based on
                    millions of reviews and considering the conservation, research and experience that visitors have, it
                    is therefore no surprise it remains at the top of the list. Omaha’s Henry Doorly Zoo is renowned
                    world-wide for its leadership in conservation and research and has the incredible exhibits to back
                    these claims up. The largest cat complex in North America, the largest indoor desert in the world,
                    world’s largest nocturnal exhibit and indoor swamp and one of the world’s largest indoor rainforests
                    are all located here at this zoo. Visitors love the tide pool touch tank where they can get up close
                    and personal with sea creatures and walking through the second largest free-flight aviary in the
                    world. Shows, feedings, education, conservation and research make this the number one zoo in the
                    world.</p>

                <h1 class="places-card-title">Singapore Zoo</h1>
                <p  id="places" class="places-card-text">This highly visited zoo is one of the only zoos in the world to be 100% cage
                    free. Instead the Singapore Zoo uses a series of moats and glass to enhance both the experience for
                    visitors and to recreate the natural habitats of the animals. This zoo has invested in rescue and
                    conservation efforts to protect wildlife and the late Steve Irwin (aka the Crocodile Hunter) greatly
                    admired them for their work. A visit to this zoo is unlike any other in the world. It is the only
                    zoo in the world where you can have breakfast with a group of free-ranging orangutans in their
                    habitat. The lush rainforest setting that encompasses the entire zoo encourages animals such as
                    free-ranging kangaroos and flying foxes to interact with the public. The daily animal feedings and
                    shows are popular amongst visitors and promoted as learning experiences rather than entertainment
                    shows.</p>
